Introduction
This document is for Spring Data Science Career track Capstone 1 project. It outlines 3 possible projects of which one will be chosen. 
CRITERIA FOR SELECTION
To begin with, I had a few criteria to select my capstone project. 
−	Strike a balance between simplicity (implementation) and complexity (advanced ML methods) enough to show-case in my portfolio of projects.   
−	It needed to be a Kaggle dataset – I do not have one to show-case. Data Validation, Cleaning and Preparation takes time and a lot of work with data set providers which are often deemed proprietary. So, a data set from a data aggregator would be preferable.
−	Business understanding takes time and a lot of work.  I want to deepen my understanding of one of the top ML techniques used by data scientists as per the Kaggle Survey “Kaggle's "The State of Data Science and Machine Learning" 2017
